API implementation for frontend team

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

Python

### Installing <a name = "installing"></a>

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Git clone

  ```bash
  git clone repo
  ```

Setup virtual environment

  ```bash
  cd backend
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate   # for linux
  venv\Scripts\activate      # for windows
  ```

Install dependencies

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Also you need to create a logs folder in the backend directory

  ```bash
  mkdir logs
  ```

Create .env file

  ```bash
  cd app
  touch .env
  ```

Copy the example in env.example and paste it in .env

  ```bash
  cp env.example .env
  ```

  You can use sqlite by default, but if you want to use postgresql, you need to install it and create a database and set it as the `DB_TYPE` in the .env file. Same goes for mysql.

Before running the server, you need to run the migrations

  ```bash
  alembic upgrade head
  ```

Run fastapi server

  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```

## üöÄ Running Tests <a name = "testing"></a>

You can use the installed dependencies to run tests.

Make sure you are in the root directory of the project.

  ```bash
  cd backend/app
  ```

  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
