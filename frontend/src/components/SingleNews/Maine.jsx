            The Sun, which governs the weather, ocean currents, seasons,
            and climate as well as permitting plant life, through photosynthesis,
            has a significant impact on planet earth. The sun origins and demise
            have long attracted the attention of scientists.

            According to the National Geographic,about 4.5 billion years ago, the
            sun began to take shape from a molecular, cloud that was mainly composed
            of hydrogen and helium. A nearby supernova emitted a shockwave, which
            came in contact with the molecular cloud and energized it. The sun is
            about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) from Earth.

            According to ScienceAlert, &quot;In about 5 billion years, the Sun is due
            to turn into a red giant. The core of the star will shrink, but its
            outer layers will expand out to the orbit of Mars, engulfing our planet
            in the process. If it&apos;s even still there.&quot;

            A 2018 study by the University of Manchester used computer modeling to
            determine that, like 90 percent of other stars, our Sun is most likely
            to shrink down from a red giant to become a white dwarf and then  end
            as a planetary nebula.

            &quot;When a star dies it ejects a mass of gas and dust - known as its
            envelope - into space. The envelope         can be as much as half the
            star&apos;s mass. This reveals the star&apos;s core, which by this
            point in the star&apos;s life is running out of fuel, eventually turning
            off and before finally dying,&quot; explained astrophysicist Albert Zijlstra
            from the University of Manchester in the UK, one of the authors of the paper.

            &quot;It is only then the hot core makes the ejected envelope shine brightly for
            around 10,000 years - a brief period in astronomy. This is what makes the
            planetary nebula visible. Some are so bright that they can be seen from
            extremely large distances measuring tens of millions of light years, where
            the star itself would have been much too faint to see.&quot;
